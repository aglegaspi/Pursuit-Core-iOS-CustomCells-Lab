Use the 'Random User API' to load a list of people into a Collection View.
The project file includes the model and necessary networking classes for hitting the API.

- Clicking on a user should segue to a Detail View Controller that displays more information about the user.

Focus on designing and building the UI programmatically. You may either use a xib file or define your cells fully programmatically.
